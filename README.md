# Personal Hammerspoon Configuration

This repository holds my personal Hammerspoon configuration.  
I am sharing it on GitHub in case it is useful to others looking to customize their macOS experience with Hammerspoon.

## Overview

- Various hotkeys for quick access to applications and utilities.
- Custom keybindings for launching apps like Mail, Visual Studio Code, and more.
- Utilities for capturing ideas, creating log entries, and toggling the Hammerspoon console.
- An organized configuration that can serve as a reference or starting point for your own setup.
